# JavaScript Basic Projects

 Some *JS* basic projetcs that I looked up on the web and recoded it myself.
 
## 1 - Counter ##
You can increase, decrease or reset the number count on screen. It will change colours once it's positive or negative. The CSS was made by me.

## 2 - Lorem Ipsum Generator ##
A text generator very similar to *Hipster Ipsum*. It can generate up to **9** paragraphs. If you don't type any number it will generate a random text each time; if you put negative numbers or above "9" it will generate random texts too. If you put 0 it will show *zero* paragraphs, obviously.
The CSS was made by me.
